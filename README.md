# Paired Writing Exercise

For this exercise, you will pair with a technical writer to edit the file configure-autodiscovery-4-task.adoc, which has some issues that should be fixed.

This is not a test, and you are welcome to ask questions as you go along. Thinking aloud is encouraged. This is meant to be a fun exercise that simulates the real collaboration that takes place in the working environment.

Have fun!

To do the exercise:

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Edit the pages/configure-autodiscovery-4-task.adoc file in GitHub.
3. Propose your changes.
4. Create a pull request.
